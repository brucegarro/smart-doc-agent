Gomez", "Lukasz Kaiser", "Illia Polosukhin"], "abstract": "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data."}}
{"document_id": "doc_batch_normalization", "fields": {"title": "Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift", "authors": ["Sergey Ioffe", "Christian Szegedy"], "abstract": "Training deep neural networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin."}}

We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers, 8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers."}}

Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on a broad set of natural language processing benchmarks."}}

The former encode multi-scale contextual information by probing incoming features with filters or pooling operations at multiple rates and effective fields of view, while the latter capture sharper object boundaries by gradually recovering spatial information. In this work we combine the advantages of both methods. Our model, DeepLabv3+, extends DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module to refine segmentation results, especially along object boundaries. We further explore the Xception model and apply depthwise separable convolution to both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder modules, resulting in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes without any post-processing."}}

By analyzing roughly fifty thousand projected images, the authors compare projected area, radius of gyration, and size ratios against the underlying 3-D properties, highlighting where common empirical relationships break down and presenting updated formulas for cluster-dilute aggregates."}}
