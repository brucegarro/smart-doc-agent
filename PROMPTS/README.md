# Prompt Library

Canonical prompt templates shared across services and evaluation scenarios.

- `system.md` — Stable system prompt for the document agent.
- `developer.md` — Engineering guidance layered on top of the system prompt.

Avoid editing these prompts inline in code; import them from this directory so future evaluations stay comparable.
